## Overview

The **EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation** is built based on the
[Architecture Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md)
and aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital
identification, authentication, and electronic signatures based on common
standards across the European Union.

The implementation follows a **modular architecture** composed of
business‑agnostic, reusable components that evolve incrementally and can be
re‑used across multiple projects.

The EUDI Wallet enables users to:

1. Obtain, store, and present PID and mDL.
2. Verify credential presentations.
3. Share data in proximity scenarios.
4. Support remote QES and other use cases via the bundled modules.
5. Perform anti‑spoofing checks, verify credentials, and manage holder
   configuration.

The **EUDIW** project provides this repository with an Android app.
Please refer to the repositories listed in the subsequent sections for
more detailed information on how to get started, contribute, and engage with
the EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation.

## Protocols

- **OpenID Federation** for OpenID Connect 1.1
- **OpenID Connect** for Verifiable Credential Issuance
- **OpenID Connect** for Verifiable Presentations

## Security

The EUDI Android Wallet adopts a defense-in-depth approach that combines strong cryptography, hardware-backed key storage, and multiple layers of authentication/verification. The main pillars are described below.
