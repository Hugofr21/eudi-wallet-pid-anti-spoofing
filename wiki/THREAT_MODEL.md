### Core Architectural Facts
* **Cryptography:** All key generation occurs within a Hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE/StrongBox). Signatures rely on ECDSA (P-256/Brainpool).
* **Storage:** Verifiable Credentials (mDoc/mDL) are encrypted at rest using SQLCipher (AES-256-GCM).
* **Network & Provisioning:** Interactions with Issuers utilize the OIDC4VCI specification, fortified with PKCE and Proof of Possession (DPoP) tokens.
* **Authentication:** User Verification leverages FIDO2/WebAuthn standards bound to the device's Secure Element.

## 2. Threat Landscape (STRIDE Matrix)
The attack tree is modeled against ultimate system compromise goals: **Unauthorized Credential Presentation** and **Systemic Identity Theft**. The following critical attack vectors have been identified and mapped to the STRIDE taxonomy:

### A. Privilege Escalation & Hardware Attacks
* **OS Compromise (`Elevation of Privilege`):** Attackers gaining root/jailbreak access to bypass standard OS sandboxing.
* **TEE Compromise (`Elevation of Privilege`):** Physical exploitation or side-channel attacks against the Secure Enclave following boot chain tampering.

### B. Information Disclosure & Tampering
* **Credential Exfiltration (`Information Disclosure`):** Extraction of the SQLite database and its subsequent decryption via in-memory key dumping.
* **Supply Chain Exploitation (`Tampering`):** Execution of malicious payloads introduced via third-party dependencies.

### C. Spoofing & Network Attacks
* **Biometric Spoofing (`Spoofing`):** Defeating the User Verification mechanism via presentation attacks (e.g., masks, deepfakes).
* **Presentation Replay (`Spoofing/Tampering`):** Interception of BLE/NFC engagement protocols during credential presentation to a Relying Party.
* **Authorization Code Interception (`Information Disclosure`):** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks during the OIDC credential issuance flow.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies & Security Controls
To neutralize the attack paths, the architecture dictates the implementation of the following verifiable controls:

| Mitigation Control | Description | Targeted Threat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hardware Attestation & CC EAL4+** | Cryptographic proof of device integrity and use of certified Secure Enclaves. | OS & TEE Compromise |
| **StrongBox Enforcement** | Flagging `setIsStrongBoxBacked(true)` to ensure keys never reside in standard RAM. | ECDSA Signature Forgery |
| **Keystore Binding** | Tying the SQLCipher master key directly to the Android Keystore, requiring biometric unlock. | SQLCipher Key Extraction |
| **Liveness Detection (PAD)** | Multi-modal 3D biometric checks to ensure user presence. | Biometric Spoofing |
| **ISO 18013-5 Session Binding** | Implementation of ephemeral Nonces and Device Engagement channel encryption. | Presentation Replay |
| **TLS Pinning & DPoP** | Enforcing Certificate Transparency and binding OIDC tokens to the device's public key. | Auth Code Interception |
| **DevSecOps Pipeline** | Continuous enforcement of CodeQL (SAST), OWASP ZAP (DAST), and strict SBOM auditing. | Malicious Dependencies |

## 4. DC API & ZKPs
*(Section reserved for Decentralized Credential API and Zero-Knowledge Proofs specifications).*

## 5. Brute-Force and Cryptographic Attack Mitigations
* **High-entropy salts & iteration count** for PBKDF2 make offline dictionary attacks computationally infeasible.
* **Rate limiting** on PIN entry (exponential back-off, temporary lock-out).
* **Hardware rate-limiting:** StrongBox and the TEE enforce a strict limit on the number of key usage attempts per second, preventing rapid trial of derived keys.
* **Constant-time comparisons** for authentication tokens to avoid side-channel timing attacks.
* **Secure random number generation** (via `SecureRandom` / `KeyGenParameterSpec`) for all Initialization Vectors (IVs), salts, and nonces.

## 7. Encryption of Sensitive Data

| Component | Algorithm | Mode | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database / file-level storage** | **AES-256** | **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)** | Provides confidentiality **and** authenticity (integrity) in a single primitive. GCM’s built-in authentication tag protects against ciphertext tampering. |
| **Derived secret keys** | **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256** | – | A password-based key-derivation function that turns the user’s PIN (or pass-phrase) into a strong 256-bit key. A per-wallet random salt and a high iteration count (≥ 200,000) make offline brute-force attacks computationally expensive. |
| **Transient session keys** | **AES-256-GCM** | – | Used for encrypting data that is only needed for the lifetime of a presentation or a remote QES flow. Session keys are generated on-the-fly and destroyed after use. |

> **Note:** All encrypted payloads include the GCM authentication tag (16 bytes) and the IV (12 bytes) stored alongside the ciphertext. The IV is generated with a cryptographically secure random number generator.

---

## 8. Hardware-Backed Key Management
* **StrongBox (Android Keystore):** When the device supports StrongBox, the wallet stores the **master encryption key** inside the hardware-isolated Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The key never leaves the TEE in clear text and can only be accessed after successful user authentication.
* **Software fallback:** On devices lacking StrongBox, keys are stored in the regular Android Keystore, which is still hardware-backed on most modern phones (Secure Element / TEE).
* **Biometric-protected key access:** The wallet registers a **BiometricPrompt** that gates the retrieval of the decryption key from the Keystore. The biometric check is combined with the user-chosen PIN (see next section) to provide **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.

---

## 9. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

| Factor | Implementation | Security Contribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PIN** | User-chosen numeric PIN (minimum 6 digits) is processed by PBKDF2 to derive an **encryption key**. | Provides something the user **knows**. PBKDF2 makes offline attacks costly. |
| **Biometrics** | Fingerprint / Face-recognition via Android’s **BiometricPrompt**. The biometric credential is never exposed to the app; only a cryptographic token from the TEE is returned. | Provides something the user **is**. The token can be combined with the PIN-derived key, ensuring that both are required to unlock the wallet. |
| **Device attestation** (optional) | SafetyNet / Play Integrity API checks that the device is genuine and unmodified. | Raises the bar against rooted or tampered devices attempting to extract secrets. |

If any factor fails, the wallet enforces **exponential back-off** and **temporary lock-out** (e.g., 30s → 1 min → 5 min → permanent wipe after configurable attempts).

---

## 10. Anti-Spoofing & Identity-Falsification Mitigation
* **Liveness detection:** The biometric APIs perform built-in liveness checks (e.g., challenge-response for face or anti-finger-lift for fingerprints).
* **Secure element attestation:** The StrongBox/TEE provides attestation certificates that prove the key material resides in a trusted environment, making it harder for malware to spoof a legitimate credential.
* **Presentation binding:** Verifiable Credentials are signed by trusted issuers (X.509 or JSON-Web-Signature) and are **cryptographically bound** to the holder’s private key stored in the Keystore. Any tampering results in a verification failure on the verifier side.
* **Replay protection:** Each presentation includes a **nonce** (or timestamp) issued by the verifier, ensuring that captured presentations cannot be replayed.

---

## 11. Credential Issuance & Self-Issued Credentials
* **Issuer-signed credentials:** The wallet can receive credentials from external trusted issuers via the OIDC-VC flow. All received VCs are validated (signature chain, revocation status, expiration) before being stored.
* **Self-issued credentials:** The wallet supports the **Self-Issued OpenID Provider** pattern, enabling users to create **personal identifiers** (e.g., a "wallet address" or "self-asserted PID"). These credentials are **self-signed** with the wallet’s private key (hardware-protected) and can be presented to services that accept self-issued VCs, subject to appropriate policy checks on the verifier side.

All issued credentials are stored encrypted (AES-GCM) and are only accessible after successful MFA.
